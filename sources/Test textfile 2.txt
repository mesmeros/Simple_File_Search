This is the fun part It takes dark in order to show light. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.

See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Use your imagination, let it go. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here.

We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Little short strokes.

Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Use what you see, don't plan it. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.

The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. This is the way you take out your flustrations. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. And maybe, maybe, maybe... That easy. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.

We'll make some happy little bushes here. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We can fix anything. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. In life you need colors.

We'll put a happy little bush here. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Poor old tree. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Very easy to work these to death.
